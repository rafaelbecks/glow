A generative visual playground for sound-reactive geometry

G.L.O.W. is a lightweight, modular, MIDI and HID reactive visual engine that draws inspiration from early computer graphics, kinetic art, geometric abstraction, and pioneers like JesÃºs Rafael Soto, Gego,  John Whitney and Thomas Wilfred. It allows musicians, performers, and artists to visualize sound through structured, evolving geometries in real time.

- **Pattern controls** - Adjust width and height of noise patterns (50-200px)
- **Opacity control** - Fine-tune grain intensity (1-20%)
- **Density settings** - Control grain density (0.5-2x)
- **Grain size** - Adjust individual grain width and height (0.5-3px)
- **Animation toggle** - Enable/disable animated grain movement

*Thanks to [grained.js](https://github.com/bfred-it/grained) for their elegant noise implementation.*

## Track-Based Luminode System

G.L.O.W. uses a track-based luminode system that creates individual instances for each track:

### Features
- **Instance-Based**: Each track gets its own luminode instance when assigned
- **Multiple Instances**: Support for multiple tracks using the same luminode type (e.g., 4 lissajous curves)
- **Independent Configuration**: Each instance has its own positioning, layout, and trajectory motion

## Trajectory Motion System

G.L.O.W. features a trajectory motion system inspired by John Whitney's non-central motion principles. Each track can have its luminodes move through space using mathematically precise motion patterns:

### Motion Types
| Trajectory | Description | Formula |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Whitney Oscillations** | Coupled harmonic motion with cos/sin combinations | `x = R1 * cos(a*t + Ï†1)`, `y = R2 * sin(b*t + Ï†2)` |
| **Lissajous Curves** | Balanced harmonic motion | `x = A * sin(a*t + Î´1)`, `y = B * sin(b*t + Î´2)` |
| **Precessing Orbit** | Non-central motion with moving centers (nested circular orbits) | Moving center with orbiting elements |
| **X-Axis Movement** | Simple horizontal oscillation | `x = A * sin(a*t + Ï†)` |
| **Y-Axis Movement** | Simple vertical oscillation | `y = A * sin(a*t + Ï†)` |
| **Triangle Wave** | Linear sawtooth motion in X and Y | Triangle wave function |
| **Circular Motion** | Perfect circular motion in XY plane | `x = A * cos(a*t + Ï†)`, `y = A * sin(a*t + Ï†)` |

### Per-Track Controls
- **Enable Motion** - Toggle trajectory motion on/off
- **Motion Rate** - Speed control (0.01 - 2.0x)
- **Amplitude** - Spatial range (0 - 200 pixels)
- **Ratio A/B/C** - Harmonic frequency relationships (0.1 - 5.0)
- **Trajectory Type** - Choose from 7 motion patterns (Whitney, Lissajous, Orbit, X-Axis, Y-Axis, Triangle, Circle)
- **Invert Motion** - Mirror the trajectory for symmetric effects

## Local Usage

Run `python3 -m http.server 8000`  and open http://localhost:8000/ in Chrome.

## Adding New Luminodes

To add a new drawing module:

1. Create a new file in `luminodes/` (e.g., `my-pattern.js`)
2. Export a class that follows the luminode pattern:

```javascript
export class MyPatternLuminode {
  constructor(canvasDrawer) {
    this.canvasDrawer = canvasDrawer;
    this.ctx = canvasDrawer.getContext();
    this.dimensions = canvasDrawer.getDimensions();
  }

  draw(t, notes, layout = { x: 0, y: 0, rotation: 0 }) {
    // Your drawing logic here
    // t = time in seconds
    // notes = array of active notes for this track
    // layout = track-specific positioning and rotation
    
    // Apply layout transform for positioning
    this.canvasDrawer.applyLayoutTransform(layout);
    
    // Your drawing code here
    
    // Restore transform
    this.canvasDrawer.restoreLayoutTransform();
  }
}
```

3. Add the export to `luminodes/index.js`
4. Add to the luminode factory in `main.js`:
   ```javascript
   this.luminodeFactory = {
     // ... existing luminodes
     myPattern: MyPatternLuminode
   }
   ```
5. Add to available luminodes in `track-manager.js`
6. Add configuration settings in `settings.js` if needed

The new luminode will automatically work with the track-based system, supporting multiple instances and efficient rendering.
