## What is G.L.O.W.?

G.L.O.W. is a real-time visual instrument that transforms your music into beautiful, geometric light patterns. Inspired by pioneers of kinetic art like Jes√∫s Rafael Soto, Gego, and John Whitney, it creates structured, evolving geometries that dance with your sound in real time.

Perfect for:
- **Musicians** performing live or in the studio
- **Visual artists** creating interactive installations
- **Performers** adding dynamic visuals to their shows
- **Anyone** who wants to see their music come to life

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup
1. **Open the application** in Chrome browser
2. **Click "Start Visualizer"** to initialize MIDI
3. **Connect your MIDI device** (keyboard, controller, etc.)
4. **Start playing** and watch the magic happen!

### System Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome recommended)
- MIDI device (keyboard, controller, or software)
- Optional: Drawing tablet for additional control

## How It Works

### The Track System
G.L.O.W. works like a digital audio workstation (DAW) with **4 independent tracks**:

- **Each track** can control a different luminodes
- **Assign any MIDI device** to any track
- **Mute or solo tracks** for creative control
- **Mix and match** different visual patterns

### Visual Effects (Luminodes)
Choose from 15 unique visual patterns, each inspired by geometric art:

**Classic Patterns:**
- **Lissajous Curves** - Elegant harmonic relationships
- **Harmonograph** - Complex patterns with natural damping
- **Sine Waves** - Pure harmonic visualizations

**3D Geometry:**
- **Sphere** - Wireframe sphere with 3D rotation
- **Polygons** - Stacked shapes with organic deformation

**Art-Inspired Patterns:**
- **Soto Grid** - Inspired by kinetic artist Jes√∫s Rafael Soto
- **Gego Networks** - Based on Gego's wire sculptures
- **Whitney Lines** - Radial patterns from computer animation pioneer John Whitney

**Natural Patterns:**
- **Phyllotaxis** - Spiral patterns found in nature
- **Moire Circles** - Concentric circles with optical effects

**Abstract Structures:**
- **Woven Net** - Interlaced geometric structures
- **Triangle** - Rotating triangular animations

## Using the Interface

### Main Controls
- **üéõÔ∏è Track Panel** - Open the track management interface
- **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** - Access advanced controls and preferences
- **C** - Clear the canvas
- **Ctrl+Option+Y** - Toggle status messages

### Track Management
1. **Open the track panel** by clicking the üéõÔ∏è button
2. **Assign MIDI devices** to tracks using the dropdown menus
3. **Choose visual effects** for each track
4. **Use M to mute** or **S to solo** tracks
5. **Solo overrides mute** - soloed tracks will always play

### Drawing Tablet Support
- **Connect a drawing tablet** for pressure-sensitive control
- **Draw directly on screen** to influence visuals
- **Pressure affects** visual intensity and parameters

## Inspiration & Background

G.L.O.W. draws inspiration from the pioneers of geometric and kinetic art:

- **Jes√∫s Rafael Soto** - Venezuelan kinetic artist known for interactive installations
- **Gego (Gertrud Goldschmidt)** - German-Venezuelan artist who created intricate wire sculptures
- **John Whitney** - Father of computer animation and abstract geometric films
- **Early Computer Graphics** - The aesthetic of 1960s-80s computer art

Each visual pattern is designed to honor these artistic traditions while providing modern, real-time control for contemporary musicians and artists.
